=== Installation ===
To install locally:

> runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=$HOME --user
> runhaskell Setup.lhs build
> runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock
> runhaskell Setup.lhs install

=== Documentation ===

The library cames with haddock documentation you can build
(see above). Also, check examples/example.hs to see a simple but
comprehensive example (it must be run from the examples
directory, since it expects to find the SomeModule.hs file
located there).

=== Contact  ===

Bug-reports, questions, suggestions and patches are all welcome.
