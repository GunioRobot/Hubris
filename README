This is a quick and dirty way to call haskell functions from ruby.

Requirements:
  - jhc <http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/>
  - gcc < ... oh, come on. don't tell me you don't have it. >
  - ruby 1.8.6 or higher
  - linux (mostly because jhc doesn't seem to be working on Mac at the moment.)
  - bash

Current working arrangement:
  write a haskell file (say foo.hs) with some ccall exports declared, as in the sample
  call "jhc_builder.sh foo.hs". This will build "libfoo.so".
  write a ruby file similar to hsload.rb in order to call the functions from ruby

Eventual plan:

Integrate with RubyInline or something similar, so we can write inline Haskell
