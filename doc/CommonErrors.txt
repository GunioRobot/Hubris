this is a quick guide to diagnosing what could be wrong.

This:
"""
/var/folders/Dz/Dz5WpFSZGUaFLA8jp8kT5E+++TM/-Tmp-/working_source.hs:7:7:
    Could not find module `Foreign':
      Perhaps you haven't installed the "dyn" libraries for package
      `base'?
"""

indicates that GHC HEAD was not installed correctly. Run something
like "find /usr/local -iname '*dyn_hi'" to check that the GHC you are
using has all its dynamic library header files installed. If it
doesn't, you probably didn't build GHC the right way: check
